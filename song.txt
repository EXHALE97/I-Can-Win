It's the year of the snake
Friends are overrated, so let's make no mistake
I watch from the distance while you poison the lake
A trail of ash that you leave in your wake
Knock me down, but I get back up
In the rain, I feel no pain from the cuts
Too much pain, is it ever enough?
In the rain, and I'm spilling my guts

You wanna hate me
You wanna try and break me
But you can't kill me
'Cause I'm already dead
You can shame me
You can try and break me down
'Cause I'm already dead
