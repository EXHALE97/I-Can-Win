It's the year of the snake
Friends are overrated, so let's make no mistake
I watch from the distance while you poison the lake
A trail of ash that you leave in your wake
Knock me down, but I get back up
In the rain, I feel no pain from the cuts
Too much pain, is it ever enough?
In the rain, and I'm spilling my guts
